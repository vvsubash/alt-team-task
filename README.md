# Hi
This is a simple web application fetching data from [Json Placeholder Site]('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/');
Therefore there are no external dependencies such as database or server environment therefrore its easy to clone and run
with in 2 steps

1. installing dependencies: npm instal
1. running dev server: npm run dev

I have chosen to do the task using Nuxt because it's the recomended way for building applications in vue from the core team also
other than implementing simple apps using vite Nuxt is robust and far more feature rich way of using vue.

I have used pinia to make the application as it is the default store manager recommended by the core team.

I have implemented internationalization using vuei18n package.


Please feel free to reach out to me.
